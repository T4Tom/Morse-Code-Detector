To be done:

RGB LED needs to be implemented:
1. needs to give a green light for each letter (or red if '?')
2. Needs to give red/green for the stage where user wants to continue after
	4 successfully inputted letters

Potentiometer could be implmented to change what is considered a dot-dash
currently it is just a time cap for each letter

Upon 4 letters, more resetting is required, i.e. changing time limit for 
	potentiometer and resetting the display and LED

Please also design your own decoder(), where the goal is to take the morse
	and feed it into the determineChar() to get the letter



For a better end result:

Implement the multicore c pico modules, since currently there are sleep
	statements spread around.

By using multicore instead we can use core1 of the pico for things like
the buzzer timings, rather than making the entire program sit around.
