# Morse Code Detector
Developed an interactive Morse Code detection system using a Raspberry Pi Pico in a team of 4. In this project, we set up a breadboard with a button to input morse code and a seven-segment display to output the correct letter.
We created a C program to decrypt the morse code input from the button in real time, which then displayed the corresponding letter on the seven-segment display. We also added a buzzer to the breadboard, which played a jingle when powering on or off, and replicated the classic Morse code telegraph sound.
